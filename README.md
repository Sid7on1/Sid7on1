- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sid7on1
- 👀 I’m interested in Deep-Learning, classic ML models
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to build ML models
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Building DL Models together
- 📫 How to reach me through sid7vish@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: Siddharth Vishwanath
- ⚡ Fun fact: Jack of all trades, master of none.


I’m a passionate and forward-thinking AI/ML enthusiast with a solid foundation in Computer Science, currently pursuing my B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning after completing a 3-year diploma in CSE. With over 4+ years of hands-on experience in programming, model design, and deep learning research, I’ve evolved from a curious learner into a developer and innovator in the field of AI.

My work is deeply rooted in building efficient, scalable, and intelligent neural architectures. I’m the creator of SLAM (Self-Attention Layered Architecture Model), a transformer-based model that introduces a novel Encoder Fusion mechanism and a custom MoE-based attention layer for improved memory efficiency, context depth, and speed. SLAM has already gone through multiple iterations, and I’m currently working on SLAM v2, which brings multimodal capabilities (text + image), staggered EF cycles, and deeply parallelized attention via custom MoE experts and MLA (Multi-Level Attention). My focus is to extend SLAM into agentic AI systems that can perceive, reason, and act with autonomy.

I’m highly experienced in Python, PyTorch, and deep learning frameworks, and I actively work with open-source LLMs like Gemma, DeepSeek, and Mistral, all running locally through Ollama. I regularly fine-tune and benchmark models on NLP and vision tasks using datasets like IMDB, CIFAR, and synthetic multimodal data. I’ve designed intelligent task managers, agent-based pipelines, and am currently building AGENX—a modular AI operating system built on top of SLAM.

Beyond the technical, I’m driven by impact. My goal is to pursue a Master’s in AI/ML at San José State University (SJSU) to immerse myself in a research-driven environment, collaborate with top minds, and bring cutting-edge innovation back into real-world applications.

Key Skills:
• Neural Network Architecture Design
• Transformers, MoE, Self-Attention, EF Cycles
• Multimodal AI (Text + Image)
• LLMs (Fine-tuning, Deployment, Local Models)
• PyTorch, Ollama, Python, Git
• Model Optimization: Inference Speed, Memory Usage, Param Count
• Research Writing, Benchmarking, and Testing

If you’re working on research, AI tools, or systems that align with my focus areas—or just passionate about building the future with AI—I’d love to connect.
